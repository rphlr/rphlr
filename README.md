Quacking in code from the moon! As the galaxy's first duck developer, I'm debugging the stars one quack at a time. 🚀🦆💻 Whether you're here to explore celestial code or share a space-bean of knowledge, you're in for an astronomical treat! 🌠✨

Currently, I am undergoing training at 42 School in Lausanne. 📚👨‍💻🚀
